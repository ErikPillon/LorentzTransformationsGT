In this work we will focus on Lorentz transformations, that are coordinate transformations between two coordinate frames that move at constant velocity relative to each other.We recall that the term "Lorentz transformations" only refers to transformations between inertial frames, usually in the context of special relativity. 	

In this work we will derive these transformations focusing on Group Theory properties.
